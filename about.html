 <b> What is our history?</b><br>

<p id="text">The hospitality industry’s history can be traced back by the end of 1700s in the Colonial Period. <br>This industry has been the subject of important development over the years as it has faced many obstacles such as the World Wars, the great depression, the industrial revolution and other social changes. <br>However, the hotel industry as seen today in its modern concept took place in the 1950s and 60s.<br>

The idea of renting an accommodation to visitors appeared since ancient times, and the modern concept of a hotel as we know started 1794, when the City Hotel opened in New York City; the City Hotel was claimed to be the first building designed exclusively to hotel operations. <br>Other similar hotel operations follow the trend and appeared in other cities such as Philadelphia, Baltimore and Boston in 1809.<br>

The 1760s industrial revolution has much lead to the emerging of hotels everywhere, mainly in England, Europe and in America.<br> The advent of new ways of transportations, hotels and resorts outside of major cities was built in the countryside and began promoting their scenery and other attractions. <br>The concept of the vacation was developed and available to more and more of the population. In the 1920’s, the construction of hotel took a boom phase where many well-known hotels were opened. As from that period a flow of famous hotels flooded in America and the rest of the world with prominent brand such as Radisson, Marriot, Hilton and more others.
